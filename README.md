# Sergio Alonso resume

One of the most important issues is to find a simple way to update and modify the content of the resume. So I have chosen [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) an easy-to-write plain text format to write my resume.

Inspired by the community driven open source iniciative [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) to create a [JSON](http://json.org/) based standard for resumes,
the markdown resume is going to be translate into a JSON file using the [markdown-to-json](https://github.com/scottstanfield/markdown-to-json) tool.
