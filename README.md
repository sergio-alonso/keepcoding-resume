# Sergio Alonso resume

Inspired by the community driven open source iniciative [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) to create a [JSON](http://json.org/) based standard for resumes.

My intention is to focus on the frontend technologies, so I'm going to mock the backend providing the data through an API, using [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to create a mock REST API for quick prototyping my frontend.

To run the server:

```bash
$ npm run serve
```

Now you can go to [http://localhost:3000/]() with your web browser.
